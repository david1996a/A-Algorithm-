# A-Algorithm-
A* algorithm implementation with C.

This is a simple A* implementation in C, this project is part of my master's degree. 

There are two files.readfile.c just reads the map data from a .csv file and stores it. And astar.c which reads the stored file and and runs the A* algorithm.

TODO: 
- I need to find the .csv file containing the data for spain.
- Implement some sort of user interface so the user can select two different points and calculate the optimal route.
